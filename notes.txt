Something that could work for navigation:
navigation cards have a front and back
the back has an approximate wind force and current
the front tells you how you move depending on ship setting
each turn you add a new navigation card to the chain, and by the end of the turn put down a ship setting
every so often (3 or 4 turns?) you flip over all of the unflipped navigation cards and resolve them
according to what the ship was set to at the time
if your destination was within some range of your location at any of those points, you arrive
maybe you draw a different navigation card depending on weather type, with stormy weather navigation
